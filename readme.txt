==================

CMS
System to create websites/blogs

After install, you become superadmin.
You can let your users create their own blogs.
And they can let their users create their content.
You can add layers to repeat all that for others domains.

Admin/console : 
- add modules to yours pages
- set contexts for modules : all, home, cat, art (or targeted cat or art)
- set designs with css builder, use face-fonts, set colors schemes
- set config and restrictions (easy access to config)
- set params of server
- create alternatives templates to the defaults
- manage/share files in user disk
- manage front admin menus
- manage your users/editors

Onplace :
- create or import articles from the web
- set meta tags to link them
- display content as site or as desktop

Framework :
- create plugins and let them be used as page or as apps

All the HTML is replaced by a system of [connectors] :
- contents are normalized
- tags are editables and can call some modules/plugins
- a motor of templates can be used
- user can create some connectors

Everything is in ajax :
- work on place to edit or add articles
- easy to configure

The coding is extremely codyfied, to be the lightest as possible.
Philum assume to be the fastest CMS actually (comparing to it's complexity), 
and work easily on low-cost servers.

The users can :
- get updates everythime
- make forks and become producer
- develop code (and design) on place in dev mode, without affect the work in prod
- share articles and files between servers
- chat between users, blogers and servers
- create tickets to ask for new needed, bug fixs, or help.
